        Hello, I'm Dylan, a web developer driven by a deep passion for creating
        dynamic and user-friendly websites. Although I'm new to the industry, I
        am dedicated to continuously expanding my skills and staying abreast of
        the latest web development trends. Along with a solid foundation in
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, I also have experience in TypeScript,
        Mongodb, Express, Firebase, and NextJS. I'm eager to leverage my
        technical knowledge to bring captivating designs to life. My enthusiasm
        for web development extends beyond the technical aspects. I thrive on
        problem-solving, collaborating with teams, and turning innovative ideas
        into reality. I believe in the power of user-centric design and strive
        to create intuitive interfaces that provide seamless experiences. While
        I may not have professional experience yet, I am open to opportunities
        to contribute and grow as a web developer. I am confident that my
        determination, eagerness to learn, and strong work ethic will enable me
        to make a meaningful impact.
